Visualizing spatial interaction characteristics with direction-based pattern maps

## Description
Visualization that presents the data using maps, data tables or diagrams so that spatial patterns can be observed, is a vital field in SI studies. This research proposes direction-based pattern maps, a new visualization approach for SI data to present the SI pattern of every place by aggregating the data in cardinal directions.</br>

## Enviroment
Python version: 3.5</br>

## Example
We apply the method to Beijing taxi trip data, which contains valid 1,034,090 records from May 13 to May 16, 2013. </br>
